  The responsibility for the development and maintenance of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) policies, procedures, and guidance is handled through the Office of Privacy and Open Government, FOIA Program. The FOIA Program Office is also reponsible for oversight of the Department of Commerce's FOIA program. The Department's FOIA operations are decentralized between 14 bureaus and operating units (BOUs). From this page, you can link to those BOUs and their electronic (on-line) FOIA libraries, learn about how the FOIA program is structured, and/or review our guidance and resources related to FOIA. You can also file and track the status of a request. The Department and its BOUs post a great deal of information on-line. If you are interested in making a request you may find the information you seek has already been posted. A good place to begin is in the electronic FOIA Libraries.                                 Return to Top                      All agencies are required by law to report to the Department of Justice on their FOIA compliance through submission of Annual FOIA Reports and Chief FOIA Officer Reports.
