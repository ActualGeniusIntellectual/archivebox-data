new FOIA case management system.  March 31, 2023, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern, will be the final day and time to file FOIA requests through the FOIAonline portal for the U.S. Department of Commerce and its components.  To submit a FOIA request electronically after March 31, 2023, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern, please do so through (http://www.FOIA.gov) www.FOIA.gov .  The responsibility for the development and maintenance of Freedom of   Information Act (FOIA) policies, procedures, and guidance is handled   through the  Office of Privacy and Open Government, FOIA Program. The   FOIA Program Office is also reponsible for oversight of the Department   of Commerce's FOIA program. The Department's FOIA operations are decentralized between 14   bureaus and operating units (BOUs).  From this page, you can link to   those BOUs and their electronic (on-line) FOIA libraries, learn about   how the FOIA program is structured, and/or review our guidance and   resources related to FOIA.  You can also file  and track the status of a   request.  The Department and its BOUs post a great deal of information   on-line.  If you are interested in making a request you may find the   information you seek has already been posted.  A good place to begin is   in the (FOIA_elibrary.html) electronic FOIA Libraries .

Please Note: The FOIA applies only to federal agencies and does not create a right of access to records held by Congress, the courts, or by state or local government agencies. The FOIA does not require agencies to: conduct research for you, analyze data, answer written questions, or create records (such as lists or statistics).
