Included are the fifteen terms of the Dublin Core\u2122 Metadata Element Set (also known as \"the Dublin Core\") plus several dozen properties, classes, datatypes, and vocabulary encoding schemes. The \"Dublin Core\" plus these extension vocabularies are collectively referred to as \"DCMI metadata terms\" (\"Dublin Core terms\" for short). These terms are intended to be used in combination with metadata terms from other, compatible vocabularies in the context of application profiles.",
