                    "This document is an up-to-date, authoritative specification of all metadata terms maintained by the Dublin Core\u2122 Metadata Initiative. Included are the fifteen terms of the Dublin Core\u2122 Metadata Element Set (also known as \"the Dublin Core\") plus several dozen properties, classes, datatypes, and vocabulary encoding schemes. The \"Dublin Core\" plus these extension vocabularies are collectively referred to as \"DCMI metadata terms\" (\"Dublin Core terms\" for short). These terms are intended to be used in combination with metadata terms from other, compatible vocabularies in the context of application profiles.DCMI metadata terms are expressed in RDF vocabularies for use in Linked Data. Creators of non-RDF metadata can use the terms in contexts such as XML, JSON, UML, or relational databases by disregarding both the global identifier and the formal implications of the RDF-specific aspects of term definitions. Such users can take domain, range, subproperty, and subclass relations as usage suggestions and focus on the natural-language text of definitions, usage notes, and examples.Each term is identified with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a global identifier usable in Linked Data. Term URIs resolve to the (DCMI Metadata Terms) document when selected in a browser or, when referenced programmatically by RDF applications, to one of four RDF schemas. The scope of each RDF schema corresponds to a \"DCMI namespace\", or set of DCMI metadata terms that are identified using a common base URI, as enumerated in the DCMI Namespace Policy. In Linked Data, the URIs for DCMI namespaces are often declared as prefixes in order to make data, queries, and schemas more concise and readable.Where applicable, the following attributes provide
