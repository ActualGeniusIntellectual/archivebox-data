This includes better tracking and highlighting economic activity that is included in GDP—a key driver of economic well-being—and capturing nonmarket goods and services that are not included in GDP but are also important determinants of economic well-being . BEA embarked on the GDP and Beyond initiative to  identify ways to use its data resources and statistical knowledge to inform the  discussion of well-being. As part of that initiative, BEA has re-packaged statistics from its core accounts with data from statistical agency partners in ways that provide new perspectives on economic well-being and the distribution and long-term growth of the economy. These measures include: Economic well-being measures like GDP per capita and inflation and employment trends. Distribution statistics such as real GDP growth by industry, real personal income per capita by state, and the distribution of personal income across households. Long-term growth indicators including trade balances, U.S. budget deficits over time, and trends in U.S. business cycles.  Spotlighting data that are already included in BEA's datasets or that can easily be derived from existing statistics provides an expanded look at trends in economic well-being and the drivers of economic growth.

GDP per capita standardizes for population and is often used as a proxy for a nation's standard of living.Real—inflation-adjusted—GDP per capita has grown more slowly than real GDP, increasing 2.5 percent per year on average between 1947 and 1973, compared with 4.0 percent for real GDP. Over the last two business cycles, between 2007 and 2022, growth slowed with real GDP per capita increasing at 1.1 percent per year and real GDP growing at 1.8 percent per year.            Data.

Real GDP per capita spreads total production across the entire population equally.Alternatively, real median equivalized personal income—that is, adjusted for household size—provides an inflation-adjusted measure of total income received by the “middle” income household, whose income is below 50 percent of households and above the other 50 percent of households.Real median personal income is a more appropriate gauge of how the U.S. economic pie is distributed because it focuses on how income accrues to households rather than on GDP, which is a measure of production.

The main driver of the difference in growth between the two measures was personal current transfer receipts, which impact personal income but not GDP. These receipts include benefits from programs like social security, Medicaid, and unemployment insurance.          Data.

Distribution of Income  Between Labor and Capital               One driver of the changing distribution of income is the movement in the share of labor income relative to capital income. "Capital income" refers to income arising from the use of fixed assets, such as property, plant, and equipment. After reaching 63 percent in 1970, labor's share of income has generally declined, and in 2022 stood at 56.1 percent. Capital's share of income increased from 37 percent in 1970 to 43.9 percent in 2022.Note that these shares do not include proprietors’ income as it is a mix of labor income and capital income. While proprietors’ income as a share of gross domestic income has remained relatively stable since 1970, any notable shifts in the relative importance of proprietors’ income or in the mix of labor income and capital income within proprietors’ income could impact the overall mix of labor income and capital income in the economy. Those impacts would not be captured here.            Data. Labor and capital shares of gross domestic income, 1947–2022 Source. BEA (https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&step=3&isuri=1&nipa_table_list=51&categories=survey) NIPA table 1.10  Labor share of income is calculated as compensation divided by gross domestic income excluding proprietors' income, which is a mix of labor and capital income. Capital share of income includes rental income, profits, and net interest and is calclulated as gross domestic income excluding compensation and proprietors' income divided by gross domestic income excluding proprietors' income.             Americans' Financial Well-Being   Trends in Household Wealth as Measured by Net Worth            Another key measure of the economic well-being of a nation is its wealth. Wealth increases economic welfare by supplementing income for large purchases, unemployment, emergencies, retirement, education, and bequests to heirs.Since 1960, household wealth—measured by net worth (that is, household assets less liabilities)—has risen every year except for in 2002 after the dotcom bust, in 2008 during the Great Recession, and in 2022 coming out of the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, the ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income (DPI) indicates whether trends in saving and wealth are in line with movements in income. During the post-WWII era, net worth of households as a percentage of DPI has risen, with net worth around eight times larger than DPI in 2022.            Data.

Inflation Trends   Percent Changes in Consumer Prices      Inflation, especially high and variable rates of inflation, can affect economic well-being, including eroding the real income and purchasing power of those on fixed incomes and more generally transferring income from debtors to creditors.After a period of deflation during the Great Depression, inflation peaked in the immediate post-WWII era and later in the 1970s and 1980s. Since the mid-1990s, inflation has generally remained in the 2 percent range, low by historical standards; however, inflation was 4.2 percent in 2021 and 6.5 percent in 2022.                  Data.

Sustainable Economic Growth   Real GDP vs Real Net Domestic Product            Economists since Adam Smith have been concerned with sustaining a level of economic growth that would provide for a rising standard of living for a growing population. In the national accounts, sustainable growth is measured by net domestic product (NDP), which is equal to GDP less depreciation, that is, what is left over for consumption after deducting the amount necessary to replace the capital used up in that production.Over the last few decades, NDP has grown more slowly than GDP. From 1973 to 2022, real NDP grew at 2.4 percent per year on average, compared with 2.6 percent for real GDP. This is the result of gross investment spending (a component of GDP) growing more slowly than depreciation. This slowing of investment spending has reduced the net investment available for activities that produce economic growth and that lead to a rise in productivity and standards of living.

The slowdown in capital services reflects a slowdown in net investment (and saving). The slowdown in multifactor productivity is much debated and reflects many factors, including the pace of technological change.

Trade and the U.S. EconomyOver Time    Total Trade and Trade Balances as Percentages of GDP       International trade is an important factor in economic growth. By allowing for specialization across nations and raising productivity, trade yields higher growth and standards of living.Between 1947 and 2022, overall U.S. trade (exports plus imports) as a percentage of GDP grew from about 10.5 percent to about 27 percent. The increased international trade—along with higher quality economic data and better-informed policies and institutions—contributed to an unprecedented period of growth in standards of living in the United States and other developed economies. Since 1947, real GDP per capita more than quadrupled in the United States.            Until the mid-1970s, the United States had an international trade balance that was usually in surplus. Over time, the U.S. trade balance moved to persistent trade deficits (with deficits on goods more than offsetting surpluses in services). These trade deficits were the result of domestic spending that exceeded domestic production, or its mirror image, low national saving that reflects the higher domestic spending. The lower investment that often accompanies lower saving may slow growth in productivity, the economy, and standards of living, thereby offsetting some of the positive contributions of international trade to economic growth.

While the "debt service to exports ratio" generally increased from the mid-1970s through the late-1990s and trended downward thereafter, it has been consistently negative, meaning that the United States receives more in foreign investment income than it pays to foreign residents.Because the U.S. dollar is an international currency, the United States' ability to service foreign debt is not constrained by the supply of currency earned through exports but by its income. Comparing net investment income payments to gross domestic income, shows that the "debt service to income ratio" has remained relatively stable over time.      Another key measure is the ratio of U.S. net liabilities to the rest of the world compared with U.S. household assets. The "international debt to asset ratio" has grown since the 1980s, with international debt equal to around 10 percent of U.S. assets in 2022.Currently, U.S. receipts from overseas investments exceed payments for foreign investments in the United States, resulting in a surplus on international investment income even though the United States has outstanding net liabilities to the rest of the world. The rates of return earned by U.S. residents on assets abroad exceed the rates of return on foreign-held assets in the United States by a large enough amount to offset U.S. debt payments to the rest of the world.

U.S. Multinational Companies' Employment in U.S. and Foreign Subsidiaries         The movement of U.S. jobs abroad by U.S. companies often is seen as a threat to the long-term growth of the U.S. economy and its ability to produce high-paying domestic jobs. A look at the data shows that most of U.S. multinational companies' employment remains in the United States. For example, in 2021, about 68 percent of U.S. multinationals' employment was in the United States.The share of foreign employment has risen as large and emerging economies like India and China have expanded their share of world income. However, most employment remains in high- and middle-income countries rather than low-income countries. Growth in foreign employment has been concentrated in middle-income countries.In addition, BEA data on U.S.-owned foreign companies show that most overseas subsidiaries sell their goods and services in the countries where they are located or to other foreign countries. In 2021, only 12 percent of U.S. foreign subsidiaries' sales were to the United States. These trends suggest that the location of foreign production is more for access to large and growing markets than for low-cost labor.           Breakout of   Foreign Subsidiary Worldwide Sales:

This includes borrowers' ability to service their debt and how borrowing in each period compares with income.For the federal government, the ability to service debt is measured by the "federal debt service ratio," calculated as federal interest payments divided by gross national income (GNI). Borrowing compared with income is measured using the "federal net borrowing to income ratio," calculated as federal total expenditures less federal total receipts divided by national income.            The federal debt service ratio has remained relatively flat over the last few decades. The federal net borrowing to income ratio has been much more volatile, peaking in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic.          Data.

Saving & Investment  for the Future    Net Saving and Net Investment as Percentages of GDP            Net investment—gross investment less depreciation—is often called sustainable investment. A significant share of gross investment in plant, equipment, and IT goes toward replacing capital that wears out (that is, depreciation). Net investment increases the nation's production capabilities.Net saving represents the amount of net income that is available to finance net investment; however, net investment can also be financed by borrowing from the rest of the world.During the post-WWII era, net investment and net saving have been trending down (with the related drags on productivity, growth, and standards of living).      The downward trend in net investment has slowed growth in U.S. capital stock and capital services, accounting for a large share of the decline in trend GDP growth (see "Trends in Real Economic Growth" above).The gap between the net investment rate and the net saving rate has widened over the last 35 years, with the net saving rate turning negative in 2008 during the Great Recession for the first time since the Great Depression.

Slide Deck and Background Materials for   Prototype Measures of Economic Well-Being and Growth Background Materials (docs/background-materials-prototype-measures-of-economic-well-being-and-growth.pdf)  Download Background Materials  Measures of Economic Well-Being and Growth    These prototype measures present  existing BEA and partner agency data that provide a deeper perspective on U.S.  economic well-being and growth. Featured statistics range from traditional  measures of economic well-being, such as GDP per capita, wealth, employment,  and inflation to measures of production and income. The measures also highlight  trends in economic growth, determinants of growth, and key factors that affect  the rate and sustainability of economic growth. Most of the data come from BEA's GDP and related  international, industry, and regional accounts. Because the measures of economic  well-being and growth are components of the accounts, they can be understood in  the context of the powerful set of macroeconomic tools that have been developed  and refined throughout the post-WWII era. These national accounts data tools,  and the research based on the national accounts, are the mainstay of  macroeconomic analysis. The national accounts framework and analytical tools  are routinely taught in universities and are used in the United States and  around the world to better understand, benchmark, and target economic growth.  These measures are presented in a consistent framework to  make them more relevant and easier to understand: The measures are mainly shown relative to other  indicators. For example, converting data to a per capita basis or presenting  saving and growth rates rather than the total levels of saving or GDP helps  users to see the underlying trends more clearly.  The longest available time series are used,  except where the scale needed for long-term comparisons would obscure important  more recent developments. The business cycle dates used are based on  turning points designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research.  For consistency, growth rates are calculated  from business cycle peak to peak or to the most recent period, except as noted.  For example, the use of 1973 as the beginning of the productivity slowdown is  consistent with the period used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and BEA, the  official statistical agencies that produce the data.  Finally, although measures like GDP and GDP per  capita are used as proxies for economic growth and standards of living, they  ignore the distribution of income and nonmarket goods and services that are  inputs to economic welfare. The information presented in this collection of  charts, as well as other work under BEA's GDP and Beyond initiative, begin to  address these gaps.    BEA's GDP and Beyond Initiative    Background  While the United States produces some of the most accurate, timely, and relevant sets of national economic accounts, in recent years, there has been a renewed interest in economic statistics that build on GDP to better understand well-being. This includes better tracking and highlighting economic activity that is included in GDP—a key driver of economic well-being—and capturing nonmarket goods and services that are not included in GDP but are also important determinants of economic well-being. BEA embarked on the GDP and Beyond initiative to identify ways to use its data resources and statistical knowledge to inform the discussion of well-being. These efforts build on decades of research and statistical improvements aimed at developing better measures of GDP and leveraging extended, or what are sometimes called "satellite," accounts to highlight specific sectors of the economy or to quantify activities that may not be captured in BEA's core set of statistics. Providing new perspectives on the economic well-being of everyday Americans will increase the public's understanding of economic trends and will improve the relevance of BEA's data for policy making. Bureau Plans  The first phase of BEA's GDP and Beyond initiative focuses on two main topics: 1) the distribution of economic growth across households, factors of production, industries, and geography and 2) trends in, and the sustainability of, economic growth within a national accounting framework. In addition, BEA will continue to place high priority on updating and extending its existing supplemental accounts supported by, and in collaboration with, other agencies, including integrated productivity and wealth accounts and satellite accounts for health care, oceans, household production, outdoor recreation, and arts and culture. Finally, BEA will evaluate its role in the broader discussion of well-being. Longer-term priorities where further research is required include aggregate measures of economic welfare, human capital, natural and environmental capital, energy, global value chain accounts, and the impact of "free" digital goods and services. To lay groundwork for the GDP and Beyond initiative, (https://www.bea.gov/about/bea-advisory-committee) BEA's Advisory Committee provided feedback on BEA's options and plans at its November 2018 and May 2019 meetings. In addition, BEA organized a distinguished panel of economists at the 2020 American Economic Association (AEA)-Allied Social Science Associations (ASSA) annual meeting to discuss the initiative. A summary of the panel's suggestions and remarks, along with an overview of BEA's plans and priorities for the (https://apps.bea.gov/scb/issues/2020/06-june/0620-beyond-gdp.htm) GDP and Beyond initiative , was published in the June 2020 Survey of Current Business . Why now?  Since the inception of the national accounts, questions have been raised about the scope of the accounts and the focus on market aggregates, such as national income and GDP. Simon Kuznets, one of the architects of the U.S. accounts, pointed to the limitations of emphasizing market transactions and excluding nonmarket activities and assets that have productive value or that enhance economic and social welfare. Over the last several decades, these concerns have been driven to the forefront by a wide range of issues. Recently, for example, questions have emerged regarding income inequality. Despite record low unemployment and steady economic growth, have all individuals, industries, and regions of the country benefited from the longest economic expansion on record? In addition, other questions have been raised about areas that are not well captured in the accounts, including the costs of and access to health care, the impact of the economy on the environment, and education. Much recent economic research also has focused on the role of "free" goods often provided via digital platforms.    Distribution of Personal Income    The latest estimates of the (https://www.bea.gov/data/special-topics/distribution-of-personal-income) distribution of personal income are available on the BEA website.  These data measure how total personal income in the United States is distributed across households and show how everyday Americans are sharing in the U.S. economy’s growth.      Feedback BEA would like input from the public to refine these  prototype measures. Data users' evaluations and comments will be used to help  review and update the information presented in this set of measures.
