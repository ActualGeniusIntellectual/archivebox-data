                                        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
                                        <p>While the United States produces some of the most accurate, timely, and relevant sets of national economic accounts, in recent years, there has been a renewed interest in economic statistics that build on GDP to better understand well-being. This includes better tracking and highlighting economic activity that is included in GDP—a key driver of economic well-being—and capturing nonmarket goods and services that are not included in GDP but are also important determinants of economic well-being.</p>
                                        <p> BEA embarked on the GDP and Beyond initiative to identify ways to use its data resources and statistical knowledge to inform the discussion of well-being. These efforts build on decades of research and statistical improvements aimed at developing better measures of GDP and leveraging extended, or what are sometimes called "satellite," accounts to highlight specific sectors of the economy or to quantify activities that may not be captured in BEA's core set of statistics. Providing new perspectives on the economic well-being of everyday Americans will increase the public's understanding of economic trends and will improve the relevance of BEA's data for policy making.</p>
                                        <p> <strong>Bureau Plans</strong></p>
                                        <p> The first phase of BEA's GDP and Beyond initiative focuses on two main topics: 1) the distribution of economic growth across households, factors of production, industries, and geography and 2) trends in, and the sustainability of, economic growth within a national accounting framework.</p>
                                        <p> In addition, BEA will continue to place high priority on updating and extending its existing supplemental accounts supported by, and in collaboration with, other agencies, including integrated productivity and wealth accounts and satellite accounts for health care, oceans, household production, outdoor recreation, and arts and culture.</p>
                                        <p> Finally, BEA will evaluate its role in the broader discussion of well-being. Longer-term priorities where further research is required include aggregate measures of economic welfare, human capital, natural and environmental capital, energy, global value chain accounts, and the impact of "free" digital goods and services.</p>
                                        <p> To lay groundwork for the GDP and Beyond initiative, <a href="https://www.bea.gov/about/bea-advisory-committee">BEA's Advisory Committee</a> provided feedback on BEA's options and plans at its November 2018 and May 2019 meetings. In addition, BEA organized a distinguished panel of economists at the 2020 American Economic Association (AEA)-Allied Social Science Associations (ASSA) annual meeting to discuss the initiative. A summary of the panel's suggestions and remarks, along with an overview of BEA's plans and priorities for the <a href="https://apps.bea.gov/scb/issues/2020/06-june/0620-beyond-gdp.htm">GDP and Beyond initiative</a>, was published in the June 2020 <em>Survey of Current Business</em>.</p>
                                        <p> <strong>Why now?</strong></p>
                                        <p> Since the inception of the national accounts, questions have been raised about the scope of the accounts and the focus on market aggregates, such as national income and GDP. Simon Kuznets, one of the architects of the U.S. accounts, pointed to the limitations of emphasizing market transactions and excluding nonmarket activities and assets that have productive value or that enhance economic and social welfare. Over the last several decades, these concerns have been driven to the forefront by a wide range of issues. Recently, for example, questions have emerged regarding income inequality. Despite record low unemployment and steady economic growth, have all individuals, industries, and regions of the country benefited from the longest economic expansion on record? In addition, other questions have been raised about areas that are not well captured in the accounts, including the costs of and access to health care, the impact of the economy on the environment, and education. Much recent economic research also has focused on the role of "free" goods often provided via digital platforms.</p>
