Governments of all levels, businesses big and small, and people everywhere rely on our numbers. Our data is nonpartisan, nonpolitical, and policy neutral. 

BEA's economists produce some of the world's most closely watched statistics, including U.S. gross domestic product, better known as GDP. We provide state and local numbers, too, plus foreign trade and investment stats and industry data. BEA's work underpins decisions about interest rates and trade policy, taxes and spending, hiring and investing, and more.
