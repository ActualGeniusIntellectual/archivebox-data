Governments of all levels, businesses big and small, and people everywhere rely on our numbers. Our data is nonpartisan, nonpolitical, and policy neutral. BEA&apos;s economists produce some of the world&apos;s most closely watched statistics, including U.S. gross domestic product, better known as GDP. We provide state and local numbers, too, plus foreign trade and investment stats and industry data. BEA&apos;s work underpins decisions about interest rates and trade policy, taxes and spending, hiring and investing, and more. Would you like to join our small but mighty federal agency?
