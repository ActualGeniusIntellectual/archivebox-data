<div class="b02__rich-text twtr-scribe-clicks-within b02__type--xlarge "> <p>Your activity on X, the information you provide to X, and our relationships with ad partners all help make promoted content more relevant for you.<br>
</p>
<p>When you use X to follow, post, search, view, or interact with posts or X accounts, we may use these actions to customize X Ads for you. For example, if you search for a specific term, we may show you promoted content related to that topic. We also might customize ads using other information about you, such as your profile information; your mobile device location (if <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/118492-how-to-use-the-location-feature-on-mobile-devices#">location features</a> are turned on); your IP address; or the apps installed on your device. This helps us show you local ads and other ads that you might prefer.</p>
<p>X may also personalize ads based on information that X and our affiliates collect and that our ad partners share with us, such as a hashed email address, a mobile device identifier, or browser-related information (a browser cookie ID).</p>
<p>This helps X display ads about things you&#x2019;ve already shown interest in from brands and businesses that you may like. For example, you could receive a Promoted Ad about a deal or promotion from a business whose website you frequent, or email newsletter you subscribe to. You could also see this business as a Follower Ad in one of your &quot;Who to Follow&quot; suggestions.
